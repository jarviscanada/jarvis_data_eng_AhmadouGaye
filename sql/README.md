###### Table Setup (DDL)

We have a relational database constitued with three tables (`cd.members`, `cd.bookings`, `cd.facilities`) which have been created in the cd schema. The three primary keys of the tables are respectively `memid` , `bookid` and `facid` which allows us to identify each row of the table in unique way. The tables are related to eachother thanks to `recommendedby`(foreign key) and `memid` (primary key) of the `cd.members` table, `facid` and `memid`(foreign keys) from `cd.bookings` table and finally `facid` (primary key) from `cd.facilities` table.
