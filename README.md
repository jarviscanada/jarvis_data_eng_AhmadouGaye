## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadouGaye](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadouGaye)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadouGaye/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadouGaye)]: Developed using Bash and PSQL languages, encapsulated in Docker containers for shipping and deployment, and all of that in a Unix environment, the Linux cluster monitor collects data about hardware specifications and places it in a database table. It also collects host usage information every minute and puts it in another table in the same database.


## Highlighted Projects
**Raspberry pi Connectivity monitor**: Implemented using a Bash script, the Raspberry Pi connectivity monitor was developed to detect Internet connection issues in real time, ensuring the functionality of the company's client devices at all times. The app periodically checks the device's Internet connection, sends signals when the connection is no longer working, and attempts to troubleshoot it using methods such as deactivating and then reactivating Wi-Fi, switching from Wi-Fi to wired or Bluetooth connections.

**Computer Vision project**: Developed using Python, OpenCV, and deep learning, it was an academic project at university that involved detecting the presence of a hand through a camera and displaying the number of fingers shown in real time.

**Database conception for a university restaurant Web/Mobile app **: Designed using SQL, with the mySQL RDBMS and Python, this project consisted in creating, normalizing, inserting datas and managing the database. The datas are inserted with a Python scripts which collects datas from a Excel file and inserts them in the appropriate tables automatically.
