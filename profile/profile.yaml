# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: As bilingual junior Mainframe developer at Jarvis, I have a good background in COBOL, DB2, ISPF, JCL, CICS and IMS. After five years of studies and eight months of internship, I obtained a B. Sc. in Applied Computer Sciences with some strong coding skills and computers organization understanding. Witnessing the fast evolution of computers and softwares is the reason why I got interested in the world of data and has guided me through Jarvis where I got specialized through many IBM certified learnings and real-world project related to Mainframe engineering and many other fields.

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed using Bash and PSQL languages, encapsulated in Docker containers for shipping and deployment, and all of that in a Unix environment, the Linux cluster monitor collects data about hardware specifications and places it in a database table. It also collects host usage information every minute and puts it in another table in the same database.
  - name: "RDBMS and SQL practical project"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadouGaye"

    description: This project serves both as a learning experience and a practical application. Through its execution, I have gained significant insights into data modeling, data definition, logical structuring for SQL queries, and data optimization techniques. In the forthcoming sections, I will delve into our database schema configuration, the SQL queries I formulated, and their respective applications.
