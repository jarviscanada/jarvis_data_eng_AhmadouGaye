# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: Passionate about technology and mathematics since a young age, I began learning to code as a teenager. Years later, I finally obtained my Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Sciences to turn my passion into a profession and pursue a career as a bilingual Data Engineer. I have mastered many languages such as SQL, Java, Python, and C++, as well as various advanced algorithms. During my studies, I completed two relevant internships lasting four months each in the software development field, as well as numerous interesting projects at university. Since graduating, I have gained experience in customer service related to fraud in banking. The software development field has always been my primary area of interest and where I aspire to build my career, driven by my passion and the exciting challenges and amazing tools it offers.

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AhmadouGaye"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed using Bash and PSQL languages, encapsulated in Docker containers for shipping and deployment, and all of that in a Unix environment, the Linux cluster monitor collects data about hardware specifications and places it in a database table. It also collects host usage information every minute and puts it in another table in the same database.

    description: Implemented using a Bash script, the Raspberry Pi connectivity monitor was developed to detect Internet connection issues in real time, ensuring the functionality of the company's client devices at all times. The app periodically checks the device's Internet connection, sends signals when the connection is no longer working, and attempts to troubleshoot it using methods such as deactivating and then reactivating Wi-Fi, switching from Wi-Fi to wired or Bluetooth connections. 
  - name: "Computer Vision project"
    git_url:
    description: Developed using Python, OpenCV, and deep learning, it was an academic project at university that involved detecting the presence of a hand through a camera and displaying the number of fingers shown in real time.

  - name: "Database conception for a university restaurant Web/Mobile app "
    git_url:
    description: Designed using SQL, with the MySQL RDBMS and Python, this project involved creating, normalizing, inserting data, and managing the database. The data is inserted using Python scripts that collect data from an Excel file and automatically insert it into the appropriate tables.
